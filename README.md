# Artificial-face-generation-using-GANs

Using DCGANs (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks) the application generates new artificial faces.

* The model is trained on [Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html)

* Used a Deep Convolutional Genrative Adversarial Network architecture to train the model.

* Here is a video of all the images that are generated while training the network for 50 epochs
